DeFi operates without centralized intermediaries like banks or brokerages, instead relying on smart contracts‚Äîself-executing contracts written in code on the blockchain that automatically carry out transactions when conditions are met.")

Created by Vitalik Buterin and launched in 2015, Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to introduce programmable contracts, which has driven the growth of DeFi, NFTs, and other decentralized solutions.
